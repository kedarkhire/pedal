<br><h3>What is Pedal?</h3>

  <p>Pedal is a simple way to discover great deals and keep track of what's happening at restaurants and bars around you.</p>
    

<br><h3>Who are you?</h3>
    
  <p>We are students at Miami University who found it difficult to remember all the different deals in town. We figured an app is the best way to catalog all this information. So far, we love using it and uploaded it to the app store. We hope you find it useful too!</p>

<br><h3>Is this it?</h3>
    <p>We're just getting started! We're using Oxford as a starting point to test and see what works and what doesn't. Our goal is to make it very simple for users to find what they want and at the same time, empower small businesses. In future updates, we hope to add searchable menus, other college towns, and even cities as well. Please get in contact with us if you have any suggestions or advice at all!</p>
    
<br><h3>Guidelines</h3>

  <p>We try our best to maintain correct info, but there are 40+ businesses listed and only two of us. If you find any errors, please let us know at <a onclick="supersonic.app.openURL('mailto:getpedal@gmail.com')" href=''>getpedal@gmail.com</a> or our twitter (@getpedal), and we'll update it right away!</p>    
    
<br><p>Thanks!</p>
    
<p>-The Pedal Team</p>
